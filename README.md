<h1>Hello World! </h1>
I‚Äôm Saaim Raad, a 3rd year Electrical Engineering undergrad student at the University of Toronto with a passion for physical AI, robotics, perception and lowl-level optimization. From advancing AI models that help companies embrace data-driven strategies to accelerating inference on edge such as AI fire detection systems for global fire departments, I strive to create impactful technology.
<br><br>
- <strong>Current Projects:</strong> </b> I‚Äôm currently a Computational Bio ML Research Intern at Pardee Labs, where I develop and work on protein prediction pipelines featuring Protein Language Models (PLMs). Recently, I distilled and quantized a variety of models, and am currently working on a project involving MCPs. 
<br><br>
- <strong>Future Goals:</strong> </b> I‚Äôm currently focusing my learning on AI x Robotics as part of my minors/focus areas at the University of Toronto, driven by a passion for advancing embodied AI. My goal is to one day build humanoid robots that are intelligent, so I never have to fold laundry again :)
