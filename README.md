<h1>Hello World! 👋 </h1>
I’m Saaim Raad, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto with a passion for AI, embedded systems, digital circuit design, and real-world problem-solving. From advancing AI models that help companies embrace data-driven strategies to engineering reliable hardware solutions like fire detection systems for global fire departments, I strive to create impactful technology.
<br><br>
- 🔭 <strong>Current Projects:</strong> </b> I’m currently a Research Intern at Unilever, where I develop high-accuracy AI models for time-series forecasting to advance industry benchmarks. Recently, I built RNN based benchmark models using PyTorch and NumPy, including Transformer, GRU, and LSTM architectures. This work set a new standard for model performance and supports Unilever’s data-driven decision-making.
<br><br>
- 🌱 <strong>Future Goals:</strong> </b> I’m currently focusing my learning on AI Engineering and Engineering Business as part of my minors/focus areas at the University of Toronto, driven by a passion for advancing deep learning and AI. My goal is to deepen my knowledge in both software and hardware—including in chip design and circuitry—to tackle some of the toughest challenges in computation and create impactful solutions.
